      <div><p class="info-text">Gmail is a free email service provided by Google. As of 2019, it had 1.5 billion active users worldwide. A user typically
         accesses Gmail in a web browser or the official mobile app. Google also supports the use of email clients via the POP and IMAP
         protocols.At its launch in 2004, Gmail provided a storage capacity of one gigabyte per user, which was significantly higher than
         its competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage, which is divided among other Google 
         services, such as Google Drive, and Google Photos. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, 
         while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the 
         message. Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a "conversation view" similar to an Internet forum. The service is notable 
         among website developers for its early adoption of Ajax.</p>
